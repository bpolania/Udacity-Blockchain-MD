# Blockchain Data

Blockchain has the potential to change the way that the world approaches data. Develop Blockchain skills by understanding the data model behind Blockchain by developing your own simplified private blockchain.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].
* For installing levelDB just follow the instructions in their (Github repo)[https://github.com/Level/levelup/blob/master/README.md].
* Finally you need to install Hapi, following these very simple instructions in (their website)[https://hapijs.com/].

### Configuring your project

- Use NPM to initialize your project and create package.json to store project dependencies.
```
npm init
```
- Install crypto-js with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file
```
npm install crypto-js --save
```
- Install level with --save flag
```
npm install level --save
```
- Install Hapi with --save flag
```
npm install hapi --save
```

### Start the Server

* Open a console an navigate to the server project root folder:

```

cd /path/to/server/Project_3_submission
```

* Run `node server.js`

* Done and done!!!

## Testing webservices end-points

- Get a block

Open a browser session and go to:

```

http://localhost:8000/block/{block_height}
```

Where block height is the height of the block you wish to get.

- Create a new block
```
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8000/block" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d $'{"body":"another block the dust"}'
```

## Testing Blockchain (simpleChain.js)

To test code:
1: Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.
2: Enter a node session, also known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).
```
node
```
3: Copy and paste your code into your node session
4: Instantiate blockchain with blockchain variable
```
let blockchain = new Blockchain();
```
5: Generate 10 blocks using a for loop
```
for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  blockchain.addBlock("test data "+i);
}
```
6: Validate blockchain
```
blockchain.validateChain();
```
7: Induce errors by changing block data
```
let inducedErrorBlocks = [2,4,7];
for (var i = 0; i < inducedErrorBlocks.length; i++) {
  blockchain.chain[inducedErrorBlocks[i]].data='induced chain error';
}
```
8: Validate blockchain. The chain should now fail with blocks 2,4, and 7.
```
blockchain.validateChain();
```
